## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9

# Restart
python app.py
```

### Browser Shows Error
- Check server is running (terminal should show Flask output)
- Try http://127.0.0.1:5001 instead
- Clear browser cache

### Predictions Are Slow
- Normal on CPU (1-2 seconds)
- This is expected behavior
